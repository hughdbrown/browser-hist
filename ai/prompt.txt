Write a Rust program for the Mac for searching the Chrome browser history
- The Chrome browser history file is at "~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History".
- The Chrome browser history file is a sqlite file.
- The main table of the sqlite file is `urls`. The schema of `urls` in the sqlite file is:
```
id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY - A unique identifier for each URL.
url: LONGVARCHAR - The URL itself.
title: LONGVARCHAR - The title of the visited webpage.
visit_count: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL - The number of times this specific URL has been visited.
typed_count: INTEGER - The number of times the user reached this URL by typing it into the address bar.
last_visit_time: INTEGER - A timestamp indicating the last time the URL was visited, stored in nanoseconds.
```
Each row in `urls` describes a visited url.

- Use the Rust `clap` crate for command line options.
- Required command line options:
-- `date-range` to search within a start date and end date. This will be compared to `urls.last_visit_time`.
-- `search` to search for text in the `urls.title`
-- `url` to search for the domain of `urls.url`

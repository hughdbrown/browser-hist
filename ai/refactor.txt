Refactor the extraction from the sqlite database and printing of rows.
Change the relevant code into two separate routines:
- one that gets the rows from the database and
- one that prints the rows with a custom format method.
Store all the results in the `struct Row` provided in the file.
Give all of the modified code explicit data type declarations.
